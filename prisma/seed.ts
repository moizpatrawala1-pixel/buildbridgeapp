// no auth, just a script you run from your terminal when you've onboarded
// someone new.
//
// This becomes unnecessary once the admin UI (Step 2 of this build) exists,
// but it's the fastest way to get your first real contractors into the
// database today, and every field here maps directly to the admin form
// we'll build next — so filling this in now isn't wasted work.
